Day 1 Assignment

1. What is your understanding of Blockchain?
Ans:A blockchain is a growing list of records called blocks, that are linked using cryptography.
Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,a timestamp, and transaction data .
Blockchain is a decentralized technology to maintain the information and data which are immutable in nature i.e. once the entries in the blockchain are made they can’t be tampered or modified. 
In simple words it is a way to store data digitally. By using blockchain we can avoid data duplication, data hacking, etc. Blockchain provides transparency for a data.


2. What is the core problem Block chain trying to solve?
Ans:
1. Security
2. Decentralization
3. Authentication


3. What are the few features Block chain will give you?
Ans:
1. Immutable
2. Tamper- proof
3. Verifiable
4. Unchangeable


4. What all things does a block contain?
Ans:
1. Block number
2. Transaction records
3. Previous block key
4. Mining key


5. How is the verifiability of Block chain has been attained?
Ans: Verifiability is achieved by using digital signature or checking hash code of the previous block. 
In verifiability we have to check the hash of the previous code.
If the hash of block 1 and pervious hash of block 2 is same the we can say that no data is changed.
